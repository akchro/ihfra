In the throes of the historic COVID-19 pandemic, the medical community was not only tasked with researching the virus and trying to learn the best ways to prevent its spread, but also with how to effectively communicate that information to the public. At this crucial moment, the relationship between the public and the medical community was more important than it had ever been. However, at a time in which the knowledge of scientists mattered the most, mistrust of medicine as a whole reached unprecedented levels.

The core of this mistrust comes from a very fundamental aspect of the scientific process that can make medical care appear inherently and consistently fallible. In April of 2020, only one month into the global lockdown, the World Health Organization dissuaded people from purchasing masks as there was little evidence at the time to support it. However, as further research was conducted the scientific consensus shifted. By June of 2020, mask mandates became a vital part of stopping the spread and preventing death as a result of these new studies. However, with science seemingly, ‘going back on its word’, many saw this as evidence that scientists didn’t know what they were doing. Many seemed to hold the notion that, ‘If they didn’t know before, why should anyone trust what they say now?’, and this sentiment held significant consequences. With many losing faith in the medical industry, in only the first few months of the pandemic, many individuals sought out alternative methods of treating COVID-19 with ineffective, or even harmful, results.

What this sentiment fails to acknowledge is that, throughout history, the way scientists have gained a better understanding of the universe as a whole, has been to question the assumptions that had been previously made. Part of what makes science a valuable measurement of truth is how, at its core, it is a self-correcting process; hypotheses that were previously considered false are never taken at face value. As CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science puts it, science’s efficacy comes from how, when “[w]e have hypotheses, we test them, and when the data show that those hypotheses aren’t right, we change them”.  As the scientific advancements during the COVID-19 pandemic have shown, only by questioning what we previously held as true, can we get closer to what actually is.
