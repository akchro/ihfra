title: 'David vs. Goliath: The WGA Writers Strike'
date: '2023-9-11'

The Writer’s Guild Association (WGA) is a union representing almost 20,000 writers who work in the entertainment industry across America. Every three years, their contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) expires. The AMPTP is the conglomerate of the most influential entertainment industries in the world, including Netflix, Amazon, Disney, and Warner Bros. to name a few. Each year, when their contract expires, the WGA outlines a series of demands for their next contract, but after six weeks of negotiations, the AMPTP has wholly refused to come back to the table. In response, at 12:01 AM on May 2, at a historic 97.85 approval rate, the writers of the WGA called a nation-wide strike.

To put it simply, this strike entails that those in the WGA will cease to write scripts for any movies or TV until the AMPTP agrees to return to the table and accept the WGA’s terms. These terms are largely based on how, even while series budgets have increased, more and more writers are being paid the Minimum Basic Agreement salary, with some writers even being paid less. On top of asking for better pay, the writer’s demands also include stopping the use of AI to replace writers and improving residual payment for writers of streaming content. The WGA continues to affirm that these demands are well within the bounds of the AMPTP, especially considering how, within the last 20 years, the industry’s profits have boomed by over $25 billion in no small part due to the writers.

Despite being fully capable of complying with the WGA’s terms, the media conglomerates of the AMPTP are responding by ensuring that the strike is as difficult as possible. In Los Angeles, writers striking by the Universal Studios property found that the company had, without the proper permits, trimmed the branches off the trees that the strikers had been using for shade and rest in the hot California sun. Meanwhile, fences were erected and sidewalks were destroyed around the Universal property, forcing writers to walk in the middle of the street on their strike routes. Of course, for each and every one of these explicitly union-busting methods, NBCUniversal has outright denied that their intentions were to affect the writer’s strike. At least for now, the position of these media giants is clear. As one anonymous executive for AMPTP explained in an interview with Deadline, the AMPTP’s plan, “is to allow things to drag on until union members start losing their apartments and losing their houses”.

The only reason these writers are able to strike in the first place, while refusing to take part in how they make a living, is in large part due to the Entertainment Community Fund. This nonprofit supports all members of the strike who are unable to pay for their basic necessities during the strike. By donating to this organization, even non-writers can help the strikers stay on the picket line longer and continue their fight for better wages.
