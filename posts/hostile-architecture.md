In city benches across the globe, a malicious but subtle type of civil engineering is taking place: hostile architecture. Hostile architecture is a type of defensive design. This kind of design occurs when engineers, city planners or architects model their designs in a way to purposefully make people feel uncomfortable, thereby keeping them out of a certain space. Most commonly, these designs are utilized in order to keep homeless individuals away from public spaces.

Examples of hostile design are as diverse and widespread as the places where it can be found. In Volgodonsk, Russia, benches are routinely locked up for the night so that homeless people are unable to comfortably sleep along the benches. Benches throughout London, England have armbars separating the benches into sections for the exact same reason. Meanwhile, in New York City subway stations, the MTA has introduced ‘leaning bars’ to replace existing benches. With a rising homeless population in NYC, city planners introduced these benches to dissuade the homeless from seeking shelter and rest in the subway station. Rather than investing in methods of financially supporting people out of homelessness, these city officials use their money to design public spaces that are actively hostile to the homeless. As Ocean Howell, professor of architectural history at the University of Oregon, puts it, “The message…[these designs send is] clear: you are not a member of the public, at least not of the public that is welcome here.”

Hostile architecture’s power comes from how difficult it is to recognize. At its core, the point of hostile architecture isn’t just to remove homeless people from public spaces; it mainly aims to make the public feel more comfortable without the sight of homeless people. City designers know that people feel less comfortable when they see homeless people, but at the same time, no one wants to feel responsible for their displacement. As a result, city planners introduce hostile architecture as a way to remove homeless people from safe places of rest without making their displacement obvious. The less recognizable it is, the better it’s able to put the public at ease. Thus, the best way to combat these oppressive designs that deny homeless people of their very right to sleep, is to call attention to hostile architecture when it exists. Hostile architecture loses its effectiveness as soon as people refuse to use it as an excuse for ignorance.
