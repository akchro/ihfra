Prison food, right up alongside school food, is incredibly infamous for its lackluster quality. The common public image of prison food is slop barely passing as inedible, and maybe some carrots on the side. It’s been made into almost a joke of sorts, with the go-to for bad cooking usually being “prison food”. The reality of the situation, however, is far from a joke.

In 2021 alone, inspector reports across the nation noted rotten chicken, rancid beef, rat feces-riddle stew, bug-infested meat patties, and fruits contaminated by fruit flies among several harmful foods served to prisoners. Consequences of this diet are seen with diseases such as  Escherichia Coli (E. Coli), norovirus, and listeria running rampant in prisons, the latter of which has a 20% mortality rate. The National Library of Medicine noted over 200 foodborne outbreaks in recent times, which resulted in 20,625 illnesses, 204 hospitalizations, and 5 deaths among prisoners. The CDC reports that these outbreaks have led to correctional inmates being 6.4 times more likely to suffer from a food-related illness than usual.

The solution is surprisingly simple: fund better food storage. Food contamination in the outside world is mainly an issue in poorer areas that lack access to common storage methods like refrigerators and freezers.  Even there, organizations such as Promethean Power Systems have funded affordable machines capable of running even without direct access to power sources. In this day and age, there really is no excuse for lacking proper food storage in a system that tends to 1.2 million convicts. The issue boils down to negligence or ignorance on the government’s part.

The likely reason this issue has been largely overlooked is because of the population it’s affecting. Prisoners are looked down upon in both the eyes of the government and the public because of their crimes. Crimes should be punished, but punishment should not mean torture. With symptoms such as urinary tract infections, diarrhea, kidney failure, neurological damage, and of course, death arising from the food they eat alone, it seems as if prisoners lose the right to be treated like human beings for their crimes.
