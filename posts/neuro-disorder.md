Neurology is a field of study that was started less than a century ago. Compared to other fields of study, neurology is very recent and an increasingly popular field in medicine.

As the lifespans of people increase due to modern medicine, diseases such as Alzheimer’s begin to appear near the end stages of a modern human’s life. This calls for the use of neuro medicinal treatments. Although this sounds quite promising, there are many problems with it.

The cost of research to solve neurological diseases is incredibly expensive as it is rare to find certain materials. In addition to research, clinical tests and experiments also take long amounts of time to perform and observe for results and research accuracy. This slows the rate of curing these diseases. Another problem is with drug administrations taking much time to allow drugs to be open for use in the public. This slows the production of the treatment itself which could have been much larger with the administrations allowing the drugs in a shorter amount of time.

There are many neurodegenerative diseases or disorders. A lot of these diseases can be hereditary or developed by environmental factors. This is similar to the psychological concept of Nature vs Nurture where traits or abilities can be determined by genes and environmental factors. Research on stopping these diseases is being worked on throughout the world however machines that are used for making discoveries such as EEG’s or MRI’s cost millions of dollars on average and for a simple act of turning off an MRI machine, it can cost up to a million dollars. Despite this cost, these machines allow neurologists access to specific neurons in the brain which also allow them to know what parts of the brain are affected with different diseases.

Other fields of research and collaborative experiments with other fields of medicine allow an increased amount of research and discovery. Examples such as cancer research in somatic cells can also help neuroscientists compare results in neurons and brain tissue. Somatic cells themselves have been studied for more than a century and have a lot of information about them found. Neurons, another type of cell on the other hand, have been studied for less than half a century with various pathways that have still not been discovered.

In the status quo, there are progressive efforts for a highly curable medication in the field of neuroscience to battle with neurodegenerative disorders. Although there isn’t a highly effective cure, there still are effective ones. For Alzheimer’s disease, medications such as Galantamine, rivastigmine, and donepezil inhibit or decrease cognitive symptoms of the disease. Medical drugs are not the only solution to these diseases. In some disorders such a Cerebral Palsy, physical and speech therapy can be used which has benefitted millions of people diagnosed.

In addition to medical treatments, ongoing research and advancements in medical technology and neuroscience shine the way for potential breakthroughs in the treatment of neurological diseases. Clinical trials, therapies, and other innovative approaches are ongoing processes which are being done in hopes of curing neurological diseases.
