On February 8th 1977, a crew of researchers descended over 2,500 meters below the surface of the water, expecting to collect data on the undersea geology of hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. Instead, what they found would lead to unparalleled breakthroughs in zoology, medicine, and even the cosmic search for extraterrestrial life.

The researchers’ deep-towed camera system descended upon and scanned across the pitch black 2°C water. As the device passed over the hydrothermal vents, the camera took a photo of, as marine geologist onboard Bob Ballard recalls, “hundreds of white clams and brown mussel shells. This dense accumulation [of life had] never [been] seen before in the deep sea”. At the time, photosynthesis appeared to be the base of all life on Earth, whether from the trees on the land to the plankton of the sea. In fact, when observing the galaxy for planets that harbored life, scientists often looked for planets that were the right distance away from the sun in order for photosynthesis to reasonably occur there.

However, at the depths the hydrothermal vents were located, there was a total absence of light, and thus this hydrothermal ecosystem they had stumbled upon had to have been living off something other than photosynthesis.
What the scientists found was that bacteria, later named Thermus Aquaticus, are able to use the carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and oxygen that are expelled by the vents and turn them into sugar in a process called chemosynthesis. This process, that does not require sunlight, is able to support entire food webs around the hydrothermal vents.

As return trips to these groundbreaking vents were made, and samples of these bacteria were taken, medical scientists were able to extract a novel kind of DNA polymerase, a protein involved in DNA replication, called Taq polymerase from the chemosynthetic bacteria. This polymerase soon became a vital aspect of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedures, a procedure that can detect the presence of a certain virus within an individual. In one of these PCR tests, as an example, a polymerase copies a virus’ DNA so it is more visible to the detecting agents within the kit. However, in order to detect the DNA, it must be denatured first; this requires, in most cases, the DNA to be heated up to about 96°C. Since the Taq polymerase came from bacteria that lives within over 400°C environments, the polymerase can withstand high temperatures without denaturing itself. This property allowed the detection process to become much more consistent, helping those with life threatening viruses detect them quicker and seek the proper medical help. Although it was certainly not the intention of the researchers on the 1977 expedition, their findings at the ocean floor would go on to save countless lives back on the surface.
